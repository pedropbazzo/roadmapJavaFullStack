# Java

## General

[Java](https://www.java.com/) is at the time of writing this document one of the 
most adopted programming language and is used for a range of projects but most noteworthy 
for the vast majority of developers is it's popularity in web application development.

To most Java consists of two vital parts [Java SE](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/) which
makes up the core of the language and [Java EE](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/) which
contains many of the tools developed for enterprise development.

It is worth noting that [Java](https://www.java.com/) is not just for web and mobile and can run
both desktop applications and embedded device systems as well.

## Android

The [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)) platform uses [Java](https://www.java.com/) as it's main programming language and
although [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/kotlin-android.html) has at the time of
writing this document started to become more common [Java](https://www.java.com/) is still very 
much relevant for [Android](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)).

## JVM languages

[Java](https://www.java.com/) is the primary language for the [JVM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_virtual_machine) but many other flavors of languages that leverage the same technology as [Java](https://www.java.com/) has been developed and can serve as an alternative.

You can find more information [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages).

## Common tools

* [Java EE](https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/7/tutorial/)
* [Spring](https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework)
* [Spring boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
