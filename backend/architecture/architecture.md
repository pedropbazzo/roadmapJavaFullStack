# Architecture

## General

Architecture is the essence of all backend development and it is vital for any software developer to have a strong understanding of the most common ways to build professional grade applications.

This is the main focus area for interview questions related to backend work and with right because this is where good programmers distinguish themselves from the bad ones and where you will spend most of your time.

## Common coding principles

A coding principle is a good rule of thumb to follow when writing code and should be considered basic training.

The following is a list of popular principles.

* [Clean code](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)
* [Premature optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_optimization#When_to_optimize)
* [Don't repeat yourself (DRY)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)
* [SOLID principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID)
* [Loose coupling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loose_coupling)

## Coding styles

At the time of writing this document [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) is the most common style of writing software and will likely be the choice style of most projects.

Mastering at least [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) should be considered basic training.

* [Object oriented programming (OOP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)
* [Functional programming (FP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming)
* [Procedural programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Procedural_programming)

## Common concepts

The following are common concepts that should be considered basic training.

* [CRUD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete)
* [Design patterns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_design_pattern)
* [Model view controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
* [Domain driven design (DDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design)

## System architectures

The following are common application architectures and understanding [the monolithic application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application) and [SOA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture) should be considered basic training.

* [The monolithic application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monolithic_application)
* [Service oriented architecture (SOA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-oriented_architecture)
* [Microservices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microservices)

## Network communication patterns

The following are common network communication patterns, [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) and [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call) should be considered basic training.

* [Representational State Transfer (REST)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer)
* [Remote procedure call (RPC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call)
* [GraphQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL)
