# TypeScript

## General

TypeScript is a language built on top of [JavaScript](../frontend/javascript/javascript.md) and although it is not used for every project using it becomes one of the best strategies to maintain a large [JavaScript](../frontend/javascript/javascript.md) codebase so if you are looking for a way to increase the scalability of your project this should be the next step.

A good rule of thumb is to use TypeScript for enterprise level projects.

## Useful tools

* [TSLint](https://palantir.github.io/tslint/)
* [ts-loader](https://webpack.js.org/guides/typescript/)
